- **Persistent logging** to timestamped files for Intune/RMM troubleshooting
- **JSON status parsing** with automatic fallback to text parsing for reliability
- **Enterprise-grade retry logic** for transient daemon communication failures
- **Advanced network diagnostics** for Relays, Nameservers, and Peer connectivity
- **OOBE/Provisioning optimized** for fresh Windows installs and automated deployments
- Enterprise-ready automation for Intune/RMM deployments
- Rich inline help and extensive version history embedded in the script header

## Versioning and Releases
- Semantic versioning rules:
  - Bug fixes and tweaks increment by 0.0.1
  - New features or functions increment by 0.1.0
  - Major versions increment by 1.0.0 and are manually decided
- Every version change must be accompanied by:
  - A new Git tag vX.Y.Z
  - A new GitHub Release for that tag

## Version History (summary)
- **v1.14.0** — 🔧 **ROBUSTNESS ENHANCEMENTS** - Added automatic retry logic for status commands, JSON status parsing with text fallback, persistent logging to files, enhanced diagnostic checks for Relays/Nameservers/Peers, and improved pre-registration connectivity validation. Perfect for corporate/restricted network environments.
- **v1.13.0** — ✅ **VALIDATION HARDENING** - Fixed critical false-positive detection in connection status validation. Enhanced status parsing with multiline regex anchors, requires BOTH Management AND Signal connected plus IP assignment. Eliminates false positives from peer connection status.
- **v1.12.0** — 🚀 **OOBE/PROVISIONING ENHANCEMENT** - Major improvements for fresh Windows installs and automated provisioning. Added aggressive state clearing, gRPC connection validation, network stack readiness validation, extended recovery with 5 retry attempts, and smart fresh vs. upgrade detection.
- **v1.11.1** — 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX** - Enhanced registration validation with stricter success criteria requiring ALL critical checks to pass. Prevents false positive "success" reports when management server connection fails.
- **v1.11.0** — 📊 **ENHANCED LOGGING** - Added error classification system with source attribution (NETBIRD/SCRIPT/SYSTEM) for improved troubleshooting and enterprise monitoring integration.
- **v1.10.2** — 🛠️ **Setup Key Validation Fix** - Fixed validation to support UUID format setup keys. Now supports UUID, Base64, and NetBird prefixed key formats.
- v1.9.0 — Initial publication to this GitHub repository. See the script header for the full historical changelog.
